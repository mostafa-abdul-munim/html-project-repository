<p/>A programming language is a set of rules which provides a way of telling a computer what operations to perform, it is a set of rules for communicating an algorithm and it provides a linguistic framework for describing computations .<p>

<p/>A programming language is a national system for describing computation in a machine-readable and human-readable form . a programming language is a tool for developing executable models for a class of problem domains .<p>

<p/>English is a natural language , it has words, symbols and rules. A programming language also has words, symbol and rules of grammar, the grammatical rules are called syntax and each programming language has a different set of syntax rules .<p>

<p/>Computer programming languages allow us to give orders to a computer in a language that the computer can understand and perform the required operations . programmers can used the programming languages to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is known as ''binary'' which consists of (0 or1) and translating programming language into binary is called ''compiling'' . Each programming language, from C language to python language has its own distinct features but sometimes there are common things between them . programming languages allow computers to quickly and efficiency process large and complex swaths of information and today there are dozens of programming languages are used in industry .<p>

<p/>Programming languages have evolved over times as better ways have been developed to design them. First programming languages were developed in the 1950s , since then thousands of languages have been developed and different programming languages are designed for different types of programs .<p>
