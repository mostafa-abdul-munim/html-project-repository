</ul>
<p/>1.	Java<p>
<p/>Pros : easy to write, compile and debug – excellent for developing modular programs and reusable code – it is platform independent for both binary and source levels.<p>
<p/>Cons : it is not speed intensive and then it can be very time consuming – it is an interpreted language – it lacks support for low level programming languages.<p>
<p/>2.	Python<p>
<p/>Pros : it comes with readable and simple syntax – it can be interpreted in many operating systems owing to its portability such as windows – it supports both object oriented and procedure oriented programming .<p>
<p/>Cons : it lacks adequate GUI tools – it is not ideal for memory intensive functions .<p>
<p/>3.	Ruby<p> 
<p/>Pros : it facilitates easy inheritance of features from standard classes – it offers a clean object hierarchy thereby making metaprogramming very convenient – it comes with a provision of open classes – it allows you to write codes from any line or column .<p>
<p/>Cons : it is backed by a relativity small community – the processing can often be quite slow – it lacks regular updates .<p>
